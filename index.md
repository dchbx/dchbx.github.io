### Welcome to the Affordable Care Act API ###

The Affordable Care Act API (ACApi) is a flexible IT framework that enables agencies to rapidly establish and extend cost-effective, online health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small businesses.

The ACApi's reusable components support core functions, promote interoperability and improve performance to help reduce the cost of implementing and operating an HBX.  These components include:

* architecture
* information model
* canononical vocabulary
* interface
* resources

The DCHBX is using the ACApi to improve DCHealthLink operation and efficiency.  It also incorporates knowledge gained and lessons learned in a useful form for the benefit and reuse of others.

The ACApi offers a flexible framework upon which to build health insurance marketplace technology. The design encourages reuse and extension by applying modern, proven system development principles:

* Convention over configuration
* Open source tools and systems
* Test-first development
* RESTful Web services

Scope: Covers individual and SHOP marketplaces.>


The District of Columbia Health Benefit Exchange Authority (DCHBX) launched the ACApi project following a condensed development cycle, culminating in an October 1, 2013 go-live of the DCHealthLink site.
