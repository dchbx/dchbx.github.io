## Welcome to the Affordable Care Act API ##
The Affordable Care Act API (ACApi) provides a taxonomy and Application Programming Interface (API) for Health Benefits Exchange (HBX) system components to access and exchange information.  The ACApi is a key element of an event-driven Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) that enables agencies to rapidly establish and extend cost-effective, online health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small businesses.

The ACApi is one in a set of reusable components that support core functions, promote interoperability, improve performance and help reduce  cost of implementing and operating an HBX.  These components include:

* Architecture
* Canonical Vocabulary
* Information Model
* Interface
* Resources

The ACApi offers a flexible framework upon which to build health insurance marketplace technology.  The design encourages reuse and extension by applying modern, proven, system development principles:

* Convention over configuration
* Open source tools and systems
* Test-first development
* RESTful Web services

The ACApi scope includes both Individual and SHOP (Business) HBX marketplaces.
