### Welcome to the Affordable Care Act API ###

The Affordable Care Act API (ACApi) is a flexible IT framework that enables agencies to rapidly establish and extend cost-effective, online health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small businesses.

The ACApi's reusable components support core functions, promote interoperability, and improve performance to help reduce the cost of implementing and operating a Health Benefits Exchange (HBX).  These components include:

* Architecture
* Information Model
* Canonical Vocabulary
* Interface
* Resources

The District of Columbia Health Benefits Exchange (DCHBX) is using the ACApi to improve DCHealthLink operation and efficiency.  It also incorporates knowledge gained and lessons learned in a useful form for the benefit and reuse of others.  The DCHBX launched the ACApi project following a condensed development cycle, culminating in an October 1, 2013 go-live of the DCHealthLink site.

The ACApi offers a flexible framework upon which to build health insurance marketplace technology.  The design encourages reuse and extension by applying modern, proven, system development principles:

* Convention Over Configuration
* Open Source Tools and Systems
* Test-first Development
* RESTful Web Services

The ACApi broadly covers the scope for the Individual and SHOP (Business) HBX marketplaces.
