## Welcome to the Affordable Care Act API ###

The Affordable Care Act API (ACApi) is a flexible IT framework that enables agencies to rapidly establish and extend cost-effective, online health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small businesses.

The ACApi's reusable components support core functions, promote interoperability, and improve performance to help reduce the cost of implementing and operating a Health Benefits Exchange (HBX).  These components include:

* Architecture
* Canonical Vocabulary
* Information Model
* Interface
* Resources

The ACApi is sponsored by the District of Columbia Health Benefit Exchange (DCHBX).  DCHBX's [DCHealthLink](https://dchealthlink.com/) site went live October 1, 2013, along with a number of other State-based Exchanges.  The ACApi organizes knowledge gained and lessons learned during DCHealthLink development into a useful form for the benefit and reuse of others. Today, DCHBX is using the ACApi to improve DCHealthLink system operation and efficiency.  

The ACApi offers a flexible framework upon which to build health insurance marketplace technology.  The design encourages reuse and extension by applying modern, proven, system development principles:

* Convention over =configuration
* Open source tools and systems
* Test-first development
* RESTful Web services

The ACApi broadly covers the scope for the Individual and SHOP (Business) HBX marketplaces.
